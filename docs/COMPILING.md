# Compiling C++
I use CLion with Visual Studio 2022 community for the C++ runtime libraries.

Look at the [clion_settings.png](clion_settings.png) for an example on configuring CLion. Pay special attention to the x64 setting. I had to type that value, since it was not in the dropdown options.

I didn't include the idea project settings files, so you'll have to make a project from source, but everything should work
based on the [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt).
