Disclaimer: happyml is constantly changing. If I see the chance for improvement, I'm going to take it. I hope that you get value out of it, 
but don't be shocked if you see changes. I'm trying to make it better, and if I find something doesn't feel right or good to me, I won't hessitate
to rewrite how it works. I hope you can appreciate the spirit of this project.
