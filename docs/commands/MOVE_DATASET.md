# MOVE DATASET (future)

Disclaimer: happyml is constantly changing. If I see the chance for improvement, I'm going to take it. I hope that you get value out of it, 
but don't be shocked if you see changes. I'm trying to make it better, and if I find something doesn't feel right or good to me, I won't hessitate
to rewrite how it works. I hope you can appreciate the spirit of this project.

## Syntax

```happyml
move dataset <original dataset name> to <new dataset name>
```

## Description and Notes
**This is a future feature.**

Renames a dataset. If the new dataset name already exists, nothing happens.

`original dataset name` is the name of the dataset you want to rename.

`new dataset name` is the new name of the dataset.

## Example

```happyml
move dataset titanic to titanic_renamed
```
